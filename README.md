Flow:

2. New admin can register himself/herself by clicking on the register link or directly proceed with the login.
3. Upon login the admin will land on page containing the various CRUD operations to be performed.
4. There are 4 operations i.e insertion,deletion,updation and viewing of the data.
5. Insertion involves inserting new records based on either name,manufacture number,composition.
6. Deletion involves searching for the appropriate record based on name or manufacture number and the respective medicine can be deleted.

8. Viewing supports viewing of the entire contents.
9. A normal user who just wants to search and view the contents of medicine can also accomplish the task by clicking on the user link.
10. Upon clicking the user link, the user lands on the page where there are two operations that the user can choose from either search or viewing of all the medicines.
